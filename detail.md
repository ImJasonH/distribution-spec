# Endpoint Detail

> **Note**: This section is still under construction.
> For the purposes of implementation, if any details below differ from the described request flows above, the section below SHOULD be corrected.
> When they match, this note SHOULD be removed.

The behavior of the endpoints are covered in detail in this section, organized by the API protocol flows (route)
consisting of requests and responses between the entities implementing the API. All aspects of the request and responses
are covered, including headers, parameters and body formats. Examples of requests and their corresponding responses, with
success and failure, are enumerated.

> **Note**: The sections on endpoint detail are arranged with an example request, a description of the request, followed by information about that request.

A list of methods and URIs are covered in the table below:

| Method | Path                               | Entity               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| DELETE | `/v2/<name>/blobs/uploads/<session_id>`  | Blob Upload          | Cancel outstanding upload processes, releasing associated resources. If this is not called, the unfinished uploads will eventually timeout.                                                                                              |

## Base

Base V2 API route.
Typically, this can be used for lightweight version checks and to validate registry authentication.

### GET Base

Check that the endpoint implements the distribution API.

```HTTP
GET /v2/
Host: <registry host>
Authorization: <scheme> <token>
```

The following parameters SHOULD be specified on the request:

| Name            | Kind   | Description                                                    |
|-----------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Host`          | header | Standard HTTP Host Header. SHOULD be set to the registry host. |
| `Authorization` | header | An RFC7235 compliant authorization header.                     |

#### On Success: OK

```HTTP
200 OK
```

The API implements V2 protocol and is accessible.

#### On Failure: Not Found

```HTTP
404 Not Found
```

The registry does not implement the V2 API.

#### On Failure: Authentication Required

```HTTP
401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: <scheme> realm="<realm>", ..."
Content-Length: <length>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "errors": [
        {
            "code": "<error code>",
            "message": "<error message>",
            "detail": ...
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

The client is not authenticated.

The following headers will be returned on the response:

| Name               | Description                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `WWW-Authenticate` | An RFC7235 compliant authentication challenge header. |
| `Content-Length`   | Length of the JSON response body.                     |

The error codes that MAY be included in the response body are enumerated below:

| Code           | Message                 | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | authentication required | The access controller was unable to authenticate the client. Often this will be accompanied by a Www-Authenticate HTTP response header indicating how to authenticate. |

#### On Failure: Too Many Requests

```HTTP
429 Too Many Requests
Content-Length: <length>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "errors": [
        {
            "code": "<error code>",
            "message": "<error message>",
            "detail": ...
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

The client made too many requests within a time interval.

The following headers will be returned on the response:

| Name             | Description                       |

|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TOOMANYREQUESTS` | too many requests | Returned when a client attempts to contact a service too many times |

## Tags

Retrieve information about tags.

### GET Tags

Fetch the tags under the repository identified by `name`.

#### Tags

```HTTP
GET /v2/<name>/tags/list
Host: <registry host>
Authorization: <scheme> <token>
```

Return all tags for the repository.
The implementation MAY impose a maximum limit and return a partial set with pagination links.

The following parameters SHOULD be specified on the request:

| Name            | Kind   | Description                                                    |
